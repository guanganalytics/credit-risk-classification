This logistic regression model in generally perform pretty well.
From the balanced_accuracy score of the model, it is 99%+, which is a very high score. it tells us the predict for the healthy loan and high-risk loan accuracy is 99% accurate.
From the confusion matrix, it is great that most of the predicted no and actual no, and most of the predicte yes and actually yes. there are only 56 false positive and 102 false negative.
From the classification report, if we had to compare the 0 prediction and 1 prediction, the 0 prediction is better, since it has a 99% precision and the 1 has a 91% precision. however both are pretty good result in model prediction.
